# Ardunio_Blinking_LED
This is a my first Arduino project. Where I made an LED blink using an arduino.

In order to run this code you will need the Ardunio IDE : https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
you will also need to make sure that your LED is connected to the 8 pin on an Arduino UNO via a wire and that thier is a second wire attached to ground.
